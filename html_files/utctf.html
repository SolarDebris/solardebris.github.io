<p>Looking at this binary we are given two binaries named spock and
scotty. When we connect to the service it seems we are interacting with
the spock binary, and are given the process id for scotty.</p>
<h3 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h3>
<p>Now looking back at the spock binary we shoud look at what
mitigations this binary has using checksec.</p>
<pre><code>    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)</code></pre>
<p>When putting it into static analysis we can see that there are
seccomp rules added to this binary. After running seccomp-tools on it.
We can see that we are able to use a few syscalls. The ones that we care
about are open, read, write, and ptrace.</p>
<pre><code>00401281      int64_t rax = seccomp_init(0)
004012a5      seccomp_rule_add(rax, 0x7fff0000, 0, 0)
004012c5      seccomp_rule_add(rax, 0x7fff0000, 1, 0)
004012e5      seccomp_rule_add(rax, 0x7fff0000, 2, 0)
00401305      seccomp_rule_add(rax, 0x7fff0000, 3, 0)
00401325      seccomp_rule_add(rax, 0x7fff0000, 5, 0)
00401345      seccomp_rule_add(rax, 0x7fff0000, 0xf, 0)
00401365      seccomp_rule_add(rax, 0x7fff0000, 0x3c, 0)
00401385      seccomp_rule_add(rax, 0x7fff0000, 0x65, 0)
004013a5      seccomp_rule_add(rax, 0x7fff0000, 0x101, 0)
004013c5      seccomp_rule_add(rax, 0x7fff0000, 0x106, 0)
004013d1      seccomp_load(rax)
004013e4      return seccomp_release(rax)</code></pre>
<h3 id="static-reversing">Static Reversing</h3>
<h4 id="spock">Spock</h4>
<p>Looking through more reversing we can see that this is the main
function that it getting called and that it is a simple buffer overflow
with 1337 bytes. When running ROPgadget there aren’t any useful gadgets
that we can use to control any of the first three registers. This should
be a simple buffer overflow but the main problem is that we don’t know
where the flag is exactly.</p>
<pre><code>0040161f      fflush(fp: stdout)
0040162e      fflush(fp: stdin)
0040164e      printf(format: &quot;Scotty&#39;s mental frequency is: %d…&quot;, zx.q(print_pid()))
0040165d      puts(str: &quot;My mind to your mind...&quot;)
00401671      printf(format: &quot;Your thoughts to my thoughts &gt;&gt;&gt;…&quot;)
00401680      fflush(fp: stdout)
0040169d      void buf
0040169d      return read(fd: 0, buf: &amp;buf, nbytes: 0x539)</code></pre>
<h4 id="scotty">Scotty</h4>
<p>Taking another look at the other binary we can see that essentially,
it takes the first argument in when running the binary and stores it
onto the heap. This is most likely either the flag or the path to the
flag. We can also see that this heap address is stored in thought1 which
is located at 0x404050.</p>
<pre><code>00401186  char* think_about(char* arg1)
0040119c      thought1 = malloc(bytes: 0x96)
004011ad      thought2 = malloc(bytes: 0x96)
004011be      thought3 = malloc(bytes: 0x96)
004011cf      thought4 = malloc(bytes: 0x96)
004011ec      strncpy(thought1, arg1, 0x96)
0040120a      strncpy(thought2, &quot;A keyboard. How quaint.&quot;, 0x96)
00401228      strncpy(thought3, &quot;Mad! Loony as an Arcturian dogbi…&quot;, 0x96)
0040124d      return strncpy(thought4, &quot;I&#39;ll not take that, Mr. Spock! T…&quot;, 0x96)</code></pre>
<p>One technique that is used when there aren’t any ROPgadgets is SROP
or Sigreturn Oriented Programming, which utilizes the sigreturn syscall
to get arbitrary code execution. The syscall is used to restore state
when switching back from kernel mode. It works in the same way that call
and return store the base pointer and saved instruction pointer on the
stack except it saves almost all of the registers.</p>
<p>The requirements for SROP are very simple, you need at least 312
bytes of user controlled data on the stack (which is for our sigreturn
frame), and you need to do a syscall with rax being set to 0xf.</p>
<h3 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h3>
<p>Overall, we found that the scotty binary was ran with the flag as its
first argument. There are two general ways to solve this. The first
being the intentional way is to use ptrace to read what is in the memory
in thought1 after getting an srop chain going. The second is that since
we have the process id, and open, read, write; we can read whats at
<code>/proc/{pid}/cmdline</code> which prints what was used to execute
that process.</p>
